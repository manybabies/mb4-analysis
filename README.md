# Data storage and organization

- Data from the main study is stored on the project's OSF repository
- Create a folder named "main_data" and a folder named "intermediates"
- To reproduce analyses, download "clean_data.csv," "cb_orders.csv," "lookingtime_reliability_data.csv," and "contributing_lab_list.csv" from OSF and place it in the "main_data" folder
- The intermediates from part 1 codes will be saved in the "intermediates" folder

# Cleaning and Analysis scripts used in manuscript ('final_analysis' folder)

- MB4_part1_data_clean.qmd: This script aggregates the three main data files and prepares the dataset for analysis
- MB4_part2_Bayesian_analysis.qmd: This script performs the main analysis
- MB4_part3_Frequentist_analysis.qmd: This script performs the frequentist analysis as a supplement

# Analysis scripts used in pilot analysis and simulations ('pilot_simulations' folder)

- The results of pilot analysis and simulations are in 'plots/simulations' and 'simulations_results'
